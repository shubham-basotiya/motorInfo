# motorInfo
MotorInfo: it contain all the information like who's start the motor and who's stop the motor and how many times motor start today (start and stop time).

To run this project into local
1. git fetch this repo
2. open two terminal
3. 1st termimal for frontend and 2nd terminal for backend
4. run "npm start" command into 1st terminal and "node server.js" into second command
5. start motorInfo porject into your default browser

Currently i'm not adding ui and backend api for storing data into database means data stored locally. when you restart the project again it lost all the data that you stroed previously.
